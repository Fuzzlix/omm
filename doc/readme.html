<h1 id="onemoremaketool.aluabasedextensiblebuildengine.">One More Maketool. A lua based extensible build engine.</h1>

<p>OMM is a lua make tool very similiar to <a href="https://github.com/stevedonovan/Lake">lake</a>. Its goal is a simpler
and cleaned up syntax, extensibility, portability between different lua
versions and operating systems. The multitreading is improved compared to
<a href="https://github.com/stevedonovan/Lake">lake</a>. All makefiles become executed in one and the same sandbox
environment. </p>

<p>To see what works and how it works, take a look at the makefiles in the
examples folder.</p>

<p>Any critics, test reports, and contibutions are welcome.</p>
